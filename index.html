EXPERIENCE

January 2013 - Present
	Full-Stack Software Engineer at GetScale Inc. We are currently using
	Coffeescript, Angular.js, Python, Django, and nginx.

Spring 2011
	I built and lead a team of students to build a complete, usable
	compiler for Tiger (A functional language with side-effects) targeting
	C written in Standard ML. The class project required only a parser,
	but I convinced my team to write a complete compiler. The code is
	available online <a href="https://github.com/bsummer4/tiger">here</a>.

Summer 2010
	I researched the idea of making a programming language over top of
	the MADNESS framework. This was using C++, under Robert Harrison at
	the University of Tenessee.

Spring 2010
	For my Senior Design class, I lead a team of programmers that wrote a
	compiler from a small subset of C into 65816 machine code using Common
	Lisp. We wrote a toy pong implementation in our C subset and demoed
	it for the class on a physical Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

Fall 2009
	I lead a team of students to build a multiplayer game using C
	and SDL. We were the only team that had a working project by the
	end of the course. There's a gameplay demo hosted on YouTube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gdwJg_pa0">here</a>.

Summer 2009
	I wrote an application to visualize the status of the jobs running
	on a cluster at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This was written
	in Java for an internship I did under Steve Miller.

Summer 2008
	I wrote an Javascript application to browse SVN repositories. The
	application used AJAX to communicate with an SVN server over the
	WebDAV protocol. This was for an internship at the Oak Ridge National
	Laboratory.

Spring 2006:
	I worked as a tutor, teaching C and C++ to undergraduate students at
	Pellissippi State Community College.
