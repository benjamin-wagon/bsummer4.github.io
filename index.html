EXPERIENCE

Language Analysis at Sourcegraph (2014,2015):
	- Added Gradle support to Sourcegraph's Java backend.
	- Created a new backend for processing Haskell code.
	  The code is open-source available online <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/srclib-haskell">here</a>.

Full Stack at Yo (2014):
	- Migrated Yo's database from Parse to MongoDB.
	- Reimplemented Yo's entire backend in Python.
	- Built several web tools using React.js and node.js.
	- Mentored junior developers by teaching them best practices and
	  helping them get up to speed on new codebases.

Full Stack at GetScale (2014):
	- Build a deployment setup using Linode, shell scripts, nginx, and uwsgi.
	- Developed data analysis and visualization using C, Purescript, and d3.js.

Tiger Compiler Targeting C (2011):
	I built and lead a team of students to build a complete, usable
	compiler for Tiger (A functional language with side-effects) targeting
	C written in Standard ML. The class project required only a parser,
	but I convinced my team to write a complete compiler. The code is
	available online <a href="https://github.com/bsummer4/tiger">here</a>.

Research Assistantship at UTK (2010):
	I researched the idea of making a programming language over top of
	the MADNESS framework. This was using C++, under Robert Harrison at
	the University of Tennessee.

C Compiler Targeting the SNES Architecture (2010):
	For my Senior Design class, I lead a team of programmers that wrote a
	compiler from a small subset of C into 65816 machine code using Common
	Lisp. We wrote a toy pong implementation in our C subset and demoed
	it for the class on a physical Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

Multiplayer Game Project (2009):
	I lead a team of students to build a multiplayer game using C
	and SDL. We were the only team that had a working project by the
	end of the course. There's a gameplay demo hosted on YouTube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gdwJg_pa0">here</a>.

Internship at ORNL (2009):
	I wrote an application to visualize the status of the jobs running
	on a cluster at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This was written
	in Java for an internship I did under Steve Miller.

Internship at ORNL (2008):
	I wrote an Javascript application to browse SVN repositories. The
	application used AJAX to communicate with an SVN server over the
	WebDAV protocol. This was for an internship at the Oak Ridge National
	Laboratory.

Tutoring C++ (2006):
	I worked as a tutor, teaching C and C++ to undergraduate students at
	Pellissippi State Community College.
