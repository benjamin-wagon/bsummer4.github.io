PROJECTS

[Networked Games Course]: Lead Programmer (C++)
	Wrote a fun, playable, multiplayer game using C and SDL. We
	created a gameplay demo which is hosted at
	(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gdwJg_pa0">youtube.com/watch?v=D9gdwJg_pa0</a>)

[Compilers Course]: Lead programmer (Standard ML)
	My team wrote a complete, usable compiler from Tiger (an impure
	functional programming language) to C.

[Senior Design Course]: Lead Programmer (Common Lisp)
	My team wrote a working compiler from a subset of C into 65816
	machine code. We wrote a toy pong implementation in the C subset
	and demoed it on a physical Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

[Internship under Robbert Harrison]: Solo Programmer (Javascript)
	I wrote an web-based SVN repository browser. I used AJAX to
	communicate with the SVN server over the WebDAV protocol.

[Internship under Steve Miller]: Solo Programmer (Java)
	I wrote a system-tray application for visually monitoring the
	status of the compute jobs running running on a cluster at ORNL.

[RA under Robert Harrison]: Research Assistant
	I researched the idea of replacing the MADNESS framework with
	a programming language. (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/m-a-d-n-e-s-s">code.google.com/p/m-a-d-n-e-s-s</a>)

[Personal Projects]:
	I have also coded a lot of small software projects
	recreationally. Some of the larger ones are hosted at
	(<a href="http://github.com/bsummer4">github.com/bsummer4</a>). Projects include: shell tools for
	organizing code and personal information, various games,
	music synthesisers and notation languages, markup languages,
	and lots of toy compilers and languages experiments
